- Hi, I’m Fatih, an electronic engineer with 7 years of experience in project management.
- I have started my computer programming journey with EDX - Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science and since then I have been working hard to improve my technical skills.
- I’m interested in:
  - Front-End Development with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, ReactJS and VueJS,
  - Back-End Development with NodeJS, Mongodb and PostgreSQL.

- I’m currently working with ReactJS/VueJS/NodeJS and really enjoying the process of learning new concepts and building fully functioning web apps.
- I'm looking forward to working as a Front-End/Full-Stack Web Developer as soon as possible to build a great career in Software Development.
