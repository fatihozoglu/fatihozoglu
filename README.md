- Hi, welcome to my profile. I’m Fatih, an electronic engineer and I have 7 years of experience in project management.
- I have started my computer programming journey with EDX - Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science and since then I have been studying to improve my technical skills.
- I’m interested in Front-End Web Development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJS and VueJS) and Data Analysis(R, Pyhton. Tableau).
- I’m currently learning ReactJS/VueJS and really enjoying the challenging process.
