- Hi, I’m Fatih, an electronic engineer with 7 years of experience in project management.
- I have started my computer programming journey with EDX - Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science and since then I have been studying to improve my technical skills.
- I’m interested in:
- Front-End Web Development with HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJS and VueJS,
- Back-End Development with NodeJS,
- Data Analysis(R, Pyhton. Tableau).

- I’m currently learning ReactJS/VueJS/NodeJS and really enjoying the challenging process.
- I'm looking forward to working as a Front-End/Full-Stack Web Developer soon and building a great career on it.
